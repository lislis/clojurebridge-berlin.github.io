<h2>How does a workshop work?</h2>

<p>On Thursday, we get all the necessary technologies onto the students' computers (the Installfest).</p>

<p>The next day we start with a general introduction, then break into small groups and work through the curriculum, with some talks and breaks in between.</p>

<p>The organizers will announce the agenda and keep an eye on time.</p>

<p>We follow the official curriculum, which starts with a step by step tutorial of Ruby basics, followed by a Rails app. If you have a more advanced group you can move through the first part more quickly. You get as far as you get, don't rush to "finish" things.</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="keep_in_mind">
<h2>Keep in mind:</h2>

<ul>
<li>There will be people with <em>all</em> kinds of computers.</li>
<li>Even though Windows might not be your preferred development environment, we're here to encourage people and meet them wherever they are right now.</li>
<li>Do NOT say bad things about Windows, even if it's frustrating.</li>
<li>If you're not sure about something, grab another volunteer.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="interaction_with_the_attendees">
<h2>Interaction with the attendees</h2>

<h4>Imagine:</h4>

<ul>
<li>You're trying to do something difficult</li>
<li>You're in a group of strangers, many of whom know how to do it better than you</li>
<li>You've tried before but got lost or bored or confused</li>
<li>You don't feel like you can articulate your thoughts and questions</li>
<li>You don't know the right names for anything</li>
</ul>

<h4>When was the last time you felt this way?</h4>

<h4>How can we help make this easier?</h4>

<h4>How can you help people feel socially comfortable?</h4>

<h4>Introductions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Include name, profession, why are you here / goals for today's class, and something silly.</li>
<li>Don't rush, even if you have a big class.</li>
<li>If someone joins the class late, ask them to introduce themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Icebreakers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Name games! Admit up front that most people are bad at learning new names.</li>
<li>Get people talking. The more comfortable they are at talking, the more likely they'll speak up when they don't understand something, or to answer someone else's question.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Try to suppress your (understandable) culturally-influenced sexism</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't hit on people. No sexual advances. None. Even at the after-party.</li>
<li>Don't make sexist jokes. Or racist, classist, or ableist jokes. Call people out if they do. A simple "That's not funny" and moving on quickly with the conversation will often suffice.</li>
<li>Don't make gender-based generalizations ("Women are better at X, because ...")</li>
<li>Don't make references to people's bodies or state your opinion of them.</li>
<li>Don't use slurs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Represent the diverse and welcoming community we stand for</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't mock other languages or technologies.</li>
<li>Leave your nerdy flame wars at the door.</li>
<li>Windows is fine. PHP is fine. Javascript is fine.</li>
<li>Be genuinely interested in people's experiences. ("You built something? That's cool. What does it do?")</li>
<li>Appreciate that different technologies have different trade-offs. Being easily accessible is one of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can you help people feel technically capable?</h3>

<h3>What kinds of insecurities might your student have?</h3>

<h3>How can you bolster their confidence?</h3>

<h4>Explain that</h4>

<ul>
<li>Not knowing stuff is normal, even the pros spend half their day googling</li>
<li>If you keep at it it gets better, more quickly than you think</li>
</ul>

<h4>Remind them</h4>

<ul>
<li>No need to make things perfect. Just build stuff, have fun!</li>
<li>Mistakes == Learning!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dealing with technical concepts</h4>

<ul>
<li>Define technical terms! Several times!</li>
<li>Assume anyone you're coaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence.</li>
<li>Remember people's backgrounds (Javascript, Ruby, Java, HTML/CSS,) and relate where possible.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to use metaphors. If they are a cook, try a cooking analogy.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Encourage collaboration and interaction</h4>

<ul>
<li>Explicitly encourage students to try to answer each other's questions.</li>
<li>If a question is asked, ask if anyone in the class thinks they can explain.</li>
<li>Be especially encouraging of the first few questions, to try to get things rolling.</li>
<li>Good responses to questions: "I'm glad you asked!" or "I actually wondered that, too." or "Great question!"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Be Super Positive, Always</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students have diverse backgrounds. Appreciate this fact.</li>
<li>If they aren't getting a concept, avoid anything that might shame them.</li>
<li>Don't be surprised when someone hasn't heard of something before.</li>
<li>Don't grab anyone's keyboard. Avoid taking over unless you think it's <em>really</em> necessary. Ask before you do. "Mind if I drive for a sec?" But really, don't.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Walk the Middle Path</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't go too deep for your class level, but also, don't gloss over things.</li>
<li>When trying to be accurate, it's easy to go down a rabbit hole of specificity. Avoid.</li>
<li>Work with the co-coaches to make sure no one goes down that rabbit hole. Accountability!</li>
<li>Explain the big picture of a command <em>before</em> they type it in.

<ul>
<li>i.e., before typing the command to deploy to Heroku, explain the difference between localhost and Heroku.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>How can you help people feel like you know what's going on?</h4>

<h4>What are things you can do to help the students trust you?</h4>

<h4>What are some things to avoid?</h4>

<h4>Establish a few ground rules</h4>

<ul>
<li>Questions are always welcome, even if the student thinks it might be dumb. "That's a <strong>GREAT</strong> question"</li>
<li>Explain that if someone has trouble (e.g., not getting the expected output), the coaches will help troubleshoot.</li>
<li>If anyone wants to switch classes, tell them they should feel TOTALLY COMFORTABLE switching at any point.</li>
<li>Breaks are a good time to have a look at what other groups are doing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Don't be afraid to:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Call on people! By name!</li>
<li>Correct people if they're wrong. Be polite and encouraging. For instance:

<ul>
<li>"Well, this might work better and this is why."</li>
<li>"Can you explain how you came to that conclusion?"</li>
<li>"Does anyone have a different answer?"</li>
<li>"Ah, I see what you're trying to do."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask yourself questions and answer them.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pace yourself!</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't go too fast. You will probably go too fast. Check in occasionally to ensure everyone is still with you.</li>
<li>You can say the same thing THREE TIMES and it will not be boring yet.</li>
<li>When you ask a question, wait TEN WHOLE SECONDS before saying anything else. People need time to think.</li>
<li>Don't let the most advanced students dictate the pacing or answer all the questions.</li>
</ul>

    <section class="slide" id="discussion_challenges">
<h2>Discussion: Challenges</h2>

<p>Talk about what problems you might anticipate, and what to do about them.</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="discussion_coaching">
<h2>Discussion: Coaching</h2>

<h4>What are the benefits of having two coaches in a group?</h4>

<h4>How can you divide the roles between the coaches?</h4>

<h4>How can you get a good dynamic between the whole team, both attendees and coaches?</h4>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="coaching_dynamics_ideas">
<h2>Coaching Dynamics (Ideas)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Talk with your co-coach beforehand to set expectations.</li>
<li>You can decide on one coach to take the lead.</li>
<li>It can make sense to have one person take the lead.</li>
<li>The other coach can give more individual assistance.</li>
<li>Swap these roles around if it makes sense. Find a healthy dynamic!</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="cocoaching_some_ideas">
<h2>Co-coaching (Some Ideas)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Both coaches can ask questions to encourage students to speak up.</li>
<li>Ask your co-coach to explain a concept; they may be more technically advanced than you!</li>
<li>Co-coaches can help people who get lost.</li>
<li>If someone falls behind, the co-coach can take them aside to do some 1-on-1.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="discussion_comprehension">
<h2>Discussion: Comprehension</h2>

<h4>How can you tell if they understand the words you're saying?</h4>

<h4>What are good questions to ask to check comprehension?</h4>

<h4>What did your favorite coaches do to gauge understanding?</h4>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="student_comprehension">
<h2>Student Comprehension</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pay attention to body language.</li>
<li>People ask questions most often when they are actively processing material. If they aren't, it might be that the material is too easy or hard. Try to figure out which it is!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Calling on people</h4>

<ul>
<li>Calling on people makes the class more interactive and engaging, and less lecture-y.</li>
<li>Don't always ask questions to the whole class: call on individuals by name.</li>
<li>Consider breaking the class into two teams and addressing questions to teams.</li>
<li>Ask people what they expect a command to produce BEFORE you hit enter.</li>
<li>Ask "How would you do #{this}?" or "If I wanted to do #{that}, what would I do?"</li>
</ul>
