# RailsGirls Coach the Coaches

Based on the [slides from the lovely people at ClojureBridge Berlin](https://github.com/clojurebridge-berlin/clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/blob/master/docs/coaches_training.deck.md)

The source document lives under `docs/coaches_training.deck.md`. To recreate the HTML use

```
gem install deckrb
deck -b docs/coaches_training.deck.md
```

Then rename the file index.html like so

```
mv coaches_training.deck.html index.html
```

And push to gh-pages to deploy.
